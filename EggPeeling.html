	<h1>WHY DOESNâ€™T MY EGG PEEL SMOOTHLY?</h1>
	<p>Sometimes when you peel the egg you may notice that bits and pieces of the egg come off with the shell. This is completely
	normal and will not affect the taste of the egg, only the appearance. There are many reasons why eggs do not peel smoothly.
	Fresh eggs are difficult to peel, while older eggs peel easier. There are many tips, tricks, and old wives tales as to how
	to peel an egg smoothly. Add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water, or a teaspoon of vinegar. Poke the bottom of the egg
	with a needle before cooking. Crack the eggs all over before putting them in the ice bath. These are just a few of the many
	tips and tricks out there.</p>
